"python3 Main.py" to run

Without pruning it can take the algo a while to start, code methods adapted from Laura Soto

1. Games:
   Pool:
	a) The approach would work
	b) The state space size would be infinite because the balls can be in any position
	c) It would take a lot of pruning to make this approach work
	d) It would work in practice because you can take time between shots
   Tennis:
	a) The approach would not work
	b) The state space size is also infinite because the players and ball can be anywhere on
	the court
	c) It would take a algorithm that can calculate faster than a tennis shot to make the approach work
	d) It would not work in practice because of the timing
   Soccer:
	a) The approach would work
	b) The state space size is infinite because of player and ball positioning
	c) The apporoach would take fast algorithms or equal strength opponents
	d) It would work in practice as seen by RoboCanes

2. Minimax and alpha-beta algorithms change for 2 player nonzero-sum games because the best move
could be making your opponent's position worse than making yours better. It is possible for any
node to be prund by alpha beta if there are no constraints on the terminals because you can view
both utility functions.
