To run algorithms:
"python3 [filename]"

Problems: Forechecking and 3checking can break because we do multiple runs

2.

Times:
No initial assigment
Initial assignment

Backtracking:
0.0143
0.0147

Foreward Checking:
0.0113
0.0123

AC-3:
0.0133
0.0153

Min Conflicts:
0.0153
0.0108

Assigning an initial variable did not seem to help but maybe that is because I choose 'Red' each time. The times are
so small it doesn't seem to matter which algorithm you use except for tha face that Foreward Checking and AC-3 can
break

3. From the 2 exercises I learned what scenarios some of these algorithms would be good for. I prefer CSP because it
is complete for me in most cases where my genetic algorithm failed more.
