1.
	a) It is possible to distinguish the most likely color of the taxi by combining 2
	probabilities

	b) p(taxi = blue | apperance = blue) = (.75) * (.10) / (.25) * (.90) + (.75) * (.10)
	   	    	   	       	     = .25

2.
	a) Using the prior probability of P(Category) you can use the conditional probs
	of P(Word(i) | Category) to find if the the document has the ith word in the dictionary.
	Then for each catergory you can find the conditional prob P(Word(i) = True | Category = c)
	which is the portion of documents c that have word i.

	b) A new document can be categorized by using conditional independence and normalization.
	P(Category | words) = alpha P(Category) SUM P(words | Category)

	c) In this case the independent assumption is unreasonable because lots of words appear in
	conjunction. A good example would be "ice" and "cream."

	a)
				IcyWeather
		Battery				StarterMotor
	Radio		Ignition				Gas
						Starts
						Moves

	b)
	prior for IcyWeather in Miami is really low so lets say .01
	P(Battery|IcyWeather) = .90, P(Battery|~IcyWeather) = .99
	P(StarterMotor|Icy) = .94, P(Battery|~IcyWeather) = .98

	c) 255 independent values (2^8 - 1)

	d) 20 independent probability values (1+2+2+2+2+8+2+1)

	e) This family in general can be defined as all the conditions that lead to the engine
	starting. If you use the principal of de Morgans laws this can also be seen as not all the
	conditions that lead the engine not starting.
